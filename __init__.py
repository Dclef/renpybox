"""
Top-level package for the oldcatporject project.  Enables absolute imports
such as `oldcatporject.utils.call_game_python`.

This file intentionally left minimal; presence turns the directory into a
Python package so import resolvers (and tooling like Pylance) can resolve
absolute imports used across the repository.
